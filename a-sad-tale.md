House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life. He
does! Ned and Catelyn and all of their children do great things in King's
Landing, bringing together all the feuding kingdoms and there is boring peace
for thousands of years. Also winter never shows up.
